# Spectrospatial LVM 1

Companion repository for our paper applying spectrospatial models to LVM data. This will not be actively updated, it is meant to be an archive.

## Notes

- This was sliced out of a larger repo for this project, WITHOUT the git history. I use `uv` to manage that project. I dumped the Python environment info into `requirements.txt`. It is likely not strictly necessary to perfectly recreate that environment to run the code.
- Although, you will need all the main ones like `jax`, `jax-finufft`, `spectracles`, `lvm-tools`, ...
- You'll also need the LVM DRP data we used. I cannot provide you with that. Sorry.
- The `production` folder contains all the code to create all the results in the paper (plus the deps).
- The `other` folder contains some other relevent-ish code I wrote when writitng the paper. It's likely not super useful but feel free to look.

## TODO

- [ ] Add link to Zenodo archive of this repo when done
- [ ] Add link to preprint when submitted
- [ ] Add link to paper when published
